# ArchInstall Personal Script

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This is *not* a universal Arch Linux installer.  
> This script is highly customized for my specific hardware and workflow.  
> **Do not use it blindly** — it will likely break your system!

## Important Notes

- **Not for general use**: The script assumes:
  - Specific disk layout (e.g., `/dev/nvme0n1`).
- **Risk of data loss**: Running this on unfamiliar hardware may erase disks.
- **No error handling**: Minimal safeguards — it expects perfect conditions.
